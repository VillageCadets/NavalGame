##  Ship Wreck

Project developed as a second group project at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> Bootcamp#34 at the end of the 7th week in the span of 3 days.

Remember the old times where you'd sit down on a Sunday afternoon with a friend to play naval battle? Well, you don't need to do that anymore, I mean, sit. You can play the game anywhere (with Internet access) with your friends. 

Multiplayer is done on a 1v1 basis via Netcat on the command line in Unix-based machines (Linux, Mac OS).

Follow the instructions provided on-screen afterwards and enjoy!
